HELP
I have a typescript error that I can't resolve. It appears only in TEST mode (with Jest).
I have to use "//@ts-ignore" on top of the import of ALL the xxx.tests.ts files, because it says: "TS2614: Module '"index"'" has no exported member 'xxx'. Did you mean to use import xxx from "index"' instead?

Everything works with //@ts-ignore, but its disheartening to not find a solution for this problem.
